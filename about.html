          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>
              When I used Windows 7, my laptop was constantly plagued by malware, ads, freezes, unexpected shutdowns, and overheating.  
              These frustrations led me to prioritize privacy and efficient resource usage. I now use Void Linux with DWM.

          <h2>What I Enjoy</h2>
          <p>
              I enjoy Japanese and English music for language learning and as background while coding.
              <a href="music.html">Browse my some music</a>.
              I prefer clean, minimal setups to maintain focus and avoid distractions.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Do</h2>
          <p>
              Spending most of my time working from home has helped me concentrate on programming and language learning.  
              I avoid social media platforms—using only Discord to stay connected with others.
          </p>

          <h2>Programming Focus</h2>
          <p>
              I've been learning Rust for about five months, with the goal of building small, efficient tools.  
              After improving my Rust skills, I plan to learn C to explore low-level programming concepts.
          </p>

          <h2>How I Keep Going</h2>
          <p>
              I believe challenges have shaped my personality, motivating me to pursue change and maintain independence. 
              Patience has been essential for staying committed to this path.
          </p>
